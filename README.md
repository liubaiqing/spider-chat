**AI conversations that branch like a spider's web — press `Tab` to spin off a deep-dive from any answer. Explore, compare, and trace back without losing context.**

An Obsidian plugin that turns ChatGPT / Claude / DeepSeek / any OpenAI-compatible API into a **branching knowledge map**. Read an AI answer, hit an unfamiliar term, select the text, press `Tab` — a child node appears, ready for the next question. Infinite depth, instant backtrack, one-click export to Obsidian Canvas / Markdown / Mermaid mindmap.

## 🤔 Why Spider?

| Scenario | Plain AI chat | Spider |
|---|---|---|
| Mid-answer, want to drill into a term | Copy-paste → new window → lose the original thread | Select text → `Tab` → child node carries the context |
| Want to compare 3 phrasings of the same question | Open 3 tabs and alt-tab | Same parent, 3 children, side-by-side |
| Done exploring, want it as notes | Copy-paste into a note, links break | Add personal node notes, then export Markdown + Canvas |
| Want AI to live inside your docs, not a separate tab | Constant window switching | Stay in Obsidian the entire time |

> **vs Copilot plugin**: Copilot is a single-thread chatbot. Spider is a multi-thread **knowledge graph** — same topic, Copilot gives you one line, Spider gives you one tree.

---

## ⚡ 30-Second Quick Start

1. **Install**: Settings → Community plugins → Browse → search `spider` → Enable
2. **Configure your API key**: Settings → Spider → fill in `apiBaseUrl` + `apiKey` + `model` (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
3. **Create your first map**: Click the spider ribbon icon (or run command `Spider: New map`) → start chatting
4. **Try Tab-branching**: Select any text in an AI response, press `Tab` — that's it

## ✨ Features

### 🌳 Infinite-Depth Branching Chat
- **No depth limit**: drill down as deep as you need; the graph grows with you
- **Optional parent context**: child node requests automatically include parent title / summary / anchor
- **Streaming responses**: typewriter-style real-time rendering with Markdown & code-block highlighting
- **Select-to-branch**: highlight any text in an AI response → `Tab` → the child's "anchor" is that exact highlight
- **Auxiliary actions**: retry, summarize, AI auto-title

### 🕸️ Interactive Knowledge Graph
- **Full-tab canvas** powered by React Flow
- **Click a node to switch context**; the chat panel follows automatically
- **Collapse / expand subtrees** to keep large maps clean
- **Auto-layout** via Dagre algorithm with active-path highlighting
- **Drag nodes** — positions persist, the canvas looks the way you left it
- **Personal node notes** — hover the pencil for a preview, click to pin and edit with autosave

### 📦 One-Click Structured Export

```
Spider Maps/
  ├── index.md                  # Obsidian entry-point note
  ├── brief.md                  # Findings, open questions, and progress
  ├── nodes/                    # One Markdown file per node
  └── map.canvas                # Visual knowledge map
```

- Canvas nodes are color-coded by state (purple = root / green = understood / gray = archived / blue = open)
- Edges carry labels (anchor text or first-question excerpt) with clear arrow directions
- Markdown files cross-link parent / child / index — backlinks wire up the full thinking chain

### 🔌 Works with Any OpenAI-Compatible API
- **Official OpenAI** (`https://api.openai.com/v1`)
- **DeepSeek / Moonshot / Qwen / GLM** (OpenAI-compatible mode)
- **OpenRouter / Together / Groq** (aggregator APIs)
- **Local LLMs**: Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio — all expose OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- **Anthropic Claude via proxy**

> 💡 Because it's the OpenAI Chat Completions spec, you just need a base URL + key + any model name that endpoint supports.

### 🔐 Privacy & Network Disclosure
- The plugin **requires network** to call AI, but **you fully control which endpoint**
- **API key stays local** (Obsidian's plugin data.json); never uploaded
- **Never reads your vault** — only sends the current node's messages + optional parent context + optional anchor text
- **Maps are 100% local**: stored as `.spider/maps/*.json`, syncable via Obsidian Sync
- **Offline-capable**: knowledge graph, navigation, export, history — everything works offline. Only "send message" needs network.

### 🌐 Bilingual UI
Switch between Chinese and English any time in settings. **Export artifacts are intentionally hard-coded to Chinese** — exports are historical records and shouldn't be retroactively rewritten when the UI language changes.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Tab` | With text selected in an AI response → create child node from that anchor. Without selection → create empty child node. |
| `Shift + Tab` | Jump to parent node |
| `← →` | Parent ↔ first child |
| `↑ ↓` | Move between sibling nodes |
| `Enter` | Send message (inside composer) |
| `Shift + Enter` | Newline (inside composer) |
| `Esc` | Clear current selection |
| `Delete` / `Backspace` | Delete current node (non-root, focus not in input) |

---

## ⚙️ Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| API Base URL | OpenAI-compatible endpoint | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| API Key | Your API key (password input, stored locally) | — |
| Model | Any model name your endpoint supports | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| Interface Language | Chinese / English | English |
| Include parent context | Send parent title/summary/anchor with child requests | ✅ on |
| Include full context | Also send parent's full message history (more tokens) | ❌ off |
| Stream responses | Stream tokens as they arrive | ✅ on |
| Tab to create child nodes | Enable the Tab shortcut | ✅ on |
| Auto-summarize nodes | AI auto-summarizes each node | ❌ off |
| Default export folder | Where export packages go | `Spider Maps` |

## 📥 Installation

### From Community Plugin Store (recommended)
1. Obsidian → **Settings** → **Community plugins**
2. Turn off Safe mode (if it's on)
3. **Browse** → search `spider` → **Install** → **Enable**
4. Settings → **Spider** → fill in your API key and model

### From Source (development)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/111pointer111/spider
cd spider
npm install
npm run build
# Copy main.js, manifest.json, styles.css into
# <vault>/.obsidian/plugins/spider/
# Then enable the plugin in Obsidian
```

Or use `npm run link` to symlink the build output to your vault and pair with `npm run dev` for live-reload during development.

## 🛠 Development

```bash
npm install        # install dependencies
npm run dev        # watch mode (esbuild)
npm run build      # production build (runs tsc --noEmit first)
npm test           # run vitest tests
npm run link       # symlink build output into your vault
```

### 🎥 Recording a Demo

> 🎬 Want to contribute a demo GIF?
> 1. Record 5–10 seconds with [Kap](https://getkap.co/) (macOS) / [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) (Windows) / `ffmpeg` (Linux)
> 2. Show: open spider → ask a question → select text in AI response → press `Tab` → child node appears → continue asking
> 3. Export as GIF, save to `.github/demo.gif`
> 4. Open a PR; we'll swap the static screenshot above for `![spider demo](.github/demo.gif)`
