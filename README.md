**AI conversations that branch like a spider's web — press `Tab` to spin off a deep-dive from any answer. Explore, compare, and trace back without losing context.**

An Obsidian plugin that turns ChatGPT / Claude / DeepSeek / any OpenAI-compatible API into a **branching knowledge map**. Read an AI answer, hit an unfamiliar term, select the text, press `Tab` — a child node appears, ready for the next question. Infinite depth, instant backtrack, one-click export to Obsidian Canvas / Markdown / Mermaid mindmap.

> The screenshot shows the Chinese interface. Spider follows Obsidian's language on first install, and you can switch between Chinese and English at any time.

## 🤔 Why Spider?

| Scenario | Plain AI chat | Spider |
|---|---|---|
| Mid-answer, want to drill into a term | Copy-paste → new window → lose the original thread | Select text → `Tab` → child node carries the context |
| Want to compare 3 phrasings of the same question | Open 3 tabs and alt-tab | Same parent, 3 children, side-by-side |
| Done exploring, want it as notes | Copy-paste into a note, links break | Add personal node notes, then export Markdown + Canvas |
| Want AI to live inside your docs, not a separate tab | Constant window switching | Stay in Obsidian the entire time |

## ⚡ 30-Second Quick Start

1. **Install**: While Community Store review is pending, install the release files manually using the steps below
2. **Configure your API key**: Settings → Spider → fill in `apiBaseUrl` + `apiKey` + `model` (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
3. **Create your first map**: Click the Spider ribbon icon (or run command `Spider: New Spider map`) → start chatting
4. **Try Tab-branching**: Select any text in an AI response, press `Tab` — that's it

## ✨ Features

### 🌳 Infinite-Depth Branching Chat
- **No depth limit**: drill down as deep as you need; the graph grows with you
- **Optional parent context**: child node requests automatically include parent title / summary / anchor
- **Streaming responses**: typewriter-style real-time rendering with Markdown & code-block highlighting
- **Select-to-branch**: highlight any text in an AI response → `Tab` → the child's "anchor" is that exact highlight
- **Selection hint**: selecting AI answer text shows a clickable “Tab Create branch” hint; clearing the selection hides it
- **Return to source**: parent and breadcrumb navigation restore your reading position and briefly highlight the source passage; other node switches retain their position for this session
- **Auxiliary actions**: retry, summarize, AI auto-title

### 🕸️ Interactive Knowledge Graph
- **Full-tab canvas** powered by React Flow
- **Click a node to switch context**; the chat panel follows automatically
- **Collapse / expand subtrees** to keep large maps clean
- **Auto-layout** via Dagre algorithm with active-path highlighting
- **Drag nodes** — positions persist, the canvas looks the way you left it
- **Personal node notes** — hover the pencil for a preview, click to pin and edit with autosave

### 📦 One-Click Structured Export

```
Spider Maps/
  ├── index.md                  # Obsidian entry-point note
  ├── brief.md                  # Findings, open questions, and progress
  ├── nodes/                    # One Markdown file per node
  ├── map.canvas                # Editable knowledge map
  └── map.svg                   # Sharp, shareable knowledge map image
```

- Canvas nodes are color-coded by state (purple = root / green = understood / gray = archived / blue = open)
- Canvas cards show concept titles, short previews, and links to full notes, with generous spacing
- Follow arrows to explore branches; source anchors stay in the notes instead of overlapping the graph
- SVG keeps card titles and previews visible at any zoom, with the same spacious layout
- Repeated exports create numbered snapshot folders, preserving earlier exports and handwritten additions
- Markdown files cross-link parent / child / index — backlinks wire up the full thinking chain

### 🔌 Works with Any OpenAI-Compatible API
- **Official OpenAI** (`https://api.openai.com/v1`)
- **DeepSeek / Moonshot / Qwen / GLM** (OpenAI-compatible mode)
- **OpenRouter / Together / Groq** (aggregator APIs)
- **Local LLMs**: Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio — all expose OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- **Anthropic Claude via proxy**

> 💡 Because it's the OpenAI Chat Completions spec, you just need a base URL + key + any model name that endpoint supports.

### 🔐 Privacy & Network Disclosure
- The plugin **requires network** to call AI, but **you fully control which endpoint**
- **API key stays local** (Obsidian's plugin data.json); never uploaded
- **Never reads unrelated vault notes** — AI requests only include the current branch plus the context options you enable
- **Maps are 100% local**: stored as `.spider/maps/*.json`, syncable via Obsidian Sync
- **Offline-capable**: knowledge graph, navigation, export, history — everything works offline. Only "send message" needs network.

### 🌐 Bilingual UI
Spider follows Obsidian's language on first install. You can switch between Chinese and English at any time, and newly generated export artifacts use the current Spider interface language.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Tab` | With text selected in an AI response → create a branch from that source. On the focused map canvas → create an empty branch. |
| `Shift + Tab` | On the focused map canvas → go to the parent branch |
| `← →` | On the focused map canvas → parent ↔ first child |
| `↑ ↓` | On the focused map canvas → move between sibling nodes |
| `Enter` | Send message (inside composer) |
| `Shift + Enter` | Newline (inside composer) |
| `Esc` | Clear current selection |
| `Delete` / `Backspace` | On the focused map canvas → delete the current non-root node |

## 📥 Installation

### From GitHub Release (while Community Store review is pending)
1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the latest [release](https://github.com/111pointer111/spider/releases/latest)
2. Create `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/spider/`
3. Copy the three files into that directory
4. Restart Obsidian, enable Spider under **Settings → Community plugins**, then configure your API key and model

After Spider is listed in the Community Store, installation will be available directly from **Settings → Community plugins → Browse**.

### From Source (development)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/111pointer111/spider
cd spider
npm install
npm run build
# Copy main.js, manifest.json, styles.css into
# <vault>/.obsidian/plugins/spider/
# Then enable the plugin in Obsidian
```

Or use `npm run link` to symlink the build output to your vault and pair with `npm run dev` for live-reload during development.

## 🛠 Development

```bash
npm install        # install dependencies
npm run dev        # watch mode (esbuild)
npm run build      # production build (runs tsc --noEmit first)
npm test           # run vitest tests
npm run test:browser # open the local URL and click Run source navigation checks (mock Obsidian API, no vault access)
npm run link       # symlink build output into your vault
```

### Project Structure

```

  state/       Multi-view session store + per-session ViewState
  storage/     Vault JSON persistence (backward-compatible with old directory)
  ui/          React components (graph, chat panel, gallery, modals)
  utils/       ID generation, path handling, activeDocument shim
tests/         vitest unit tests (domain + export + AI layers)
__mocks__/     Obsidian API stub for vitest
```

## 🧭 Roadmap (running list)
